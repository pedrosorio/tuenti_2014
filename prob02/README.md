Start processing the line at # assuming coordinates (0,0) and follow the instructions in the statement, storing the coordinates visited and the corresponding character to be printed in a python dictionary while keeping track of the min/max x/y coordinates visited.
Then, cycle from the min x/y to the max x/y, printing the characters or empty space if the (x,y) is not in the dictionary.
